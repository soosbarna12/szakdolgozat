# Weather Warehouse

  

**Weather Warehouse** is a full-stack weather application that presents users with current weather, forecast, historical, and additional weather-related data. The project is divided into two main parts: a Node.js/Express backend serving APIs and a React (with TypeScript) frontend that provides a modern, interactive user interface.

## Technologies & Packages

  

### Backend

-  **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for the server.

-  **Express** – Minimalist web framework for building API endpoints.

-  **CORS** – Middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing.

  

### Frontend

-  **React & TypeScript** – For building a robust, component-driven UI.

-  **Material UI** – Implements Google's Material Design for theming and UI components.

-  **React Router** – Handles routing within the single-page application.

-  **TanStack React Query** – Manages data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

-  **Local Storage** – Persists the user's theme (light or dark) across sessions.

  

### Additional Tools

-  **Git** – Version control system to track and manage changes.

-  **Prettier** – Code formatting tool.
